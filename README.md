## What's on the shelf

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **[DDIA, as a live comic](https://systemscomic.com/ddia)** | complete, growing | Replication, partitioning, consensus — twelve short comics, each built around one misconception it exists to kill. Then met again inside Kafka, Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, the web tier and S3, in nine-chapter deep-dives with animated traces and a hardware envelope you can overload. Plus two whole applications you push until they break. |
| **[The Papers That Broke the Database](https://systemscomic.com/papers)** | being written | The history of distributed systems through the papers that made it, one forcing event per chapter. You design the answer before the paper gives it to you. Shipping a chapter at a time; the whole season's map is on the page. |
| **[The calculator](https://systemscomic.com/calculator)** | shared instrument | Put in a workload, get machine counts back — and check every number against the division that produced it. |

Book one is an unofficial companion to ***Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, 1st edition, by
Martin Kleppmann** — chapter numbers follow that edition, since the 2nd renumbers. **Unofficial and
not affiliated** with the author or O'Reilly. Read the book; this is a lens on it, not a
replacement. Primary sources are linked at the point of use throughout.

Every limit here is an order-of-magnitude rule of thumb, useful for intuition. Verify against your
own load tests before committing production capacity.
