            RabbitMQ is the <b>opposite bet from Kafka</b>, made a decade earlier: put the
            intelligence in the <b>broker</b> — routing, delivery tracking, per-message
            acknowledgement, retries, dead-lettering — so that clients stay simple and messages
            behave like <em>tasks</em>, not log entries. Every strength (routing topologies,
            backpressure, work distribution) and every constraint (the one-core queue, the memory
            watermark, no replay) follows from that one choice. This page walks the system the way
            you&apos;d want it explained: <b>what the broker actually does with one message</b>,
            what hardware it consumes, and only then how it scales.

              The AMQP model is three objects and a contract. Producers publish to{' '}
              <b>exchanges</b> (named routers), exchanges match <b>bindings</b> (routing rules) to
              deliver into <b>queues</b>, and queues push to consumers who must{' '}
              <b>acknowledge</b> each message — at which point it is deleted. The broker owns the
              whole lifecycle: it knows every unacked delivery, redelivers on failure, expires,
              dead-letters, and prioritizes. A message is a <em>unit of work with a chain of
              custody</em>, and the broker is the custodian.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compare the Kafka page&apos;s opening move: Kafka made the broker <em>dumb</em> — an
              append-only log that tracks nothing per consumer — and pushed all delivery
              intelligence to clients, buying colossal throughput. RabbitMQ keeps the intelligence
              central and pays for it <b>per message</b>: routing computation, delivery state,
              ack bookkeeping. That price sets every ceiling in Chapter 3 — and buys semantics
              Kafka cannot express: route this message to <em>these</em> queues, retry it three
              times, then park it for a human.
            </p>
            <div className="note">
              <b>The lineage.</b> Kafka bet on the log; Postgres on WAL + MVCC; Redis on RAM +
              one thread. RabbitMQ&apos;s bet is the <em>actor model</em>: everything — every
              queue, channel, connection — is an isolated Erlang process passing messages. The
              broker for messages is itself built out of message passing, and its scaling law
              (Chapter 2&apos;s second trace) falls straight out of that.

            <p>
              Unlike Redis, a bigger box genuinely helps — <b>if your queue count cooperates</b>.
              More cores run more queue processes in parallel; a node with 16 cores and 200 queues
              uses them all. More RAM moves the watermark up, buying tolerance for bursts and
              bigger in-flight windows. Faster NVMe directly cuts confirm latency for durable and
              quorum traffic, since a majority fsync sits on the write path of every confirmed
              publish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The catches are structural. A <b>single hot queue</b> gets nothing from any of it —
              its ceiling is one process on one core, whatever the box. RAM spent tolerating
              deeper backlogs is spent <em>enabling the anti-pattern</em>: the system is designed
              for empty queues, and hardware that lets debt accumulate quietly just moves the
              cliff. And bigger nodes mean bigger blast radii — more queue leaders failing over at
              once, longer quorum re-syncs. The estate answer (Chapter 7) is the same as
              Kafka&apos;s and Redis&apos;s: <b>modest nodes, more of them, leaders spread</b>.
