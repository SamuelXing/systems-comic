/* Every recommendation must be reachable.

   A card that can never fire is dead weight pretending to be advice, and a
   card that ALWAYS fires is not advice either. This sweeps the requirement
   axes and one workload knob at a time, and asserts each component both
   appears and disappears somewhere in that space.

   It also encodes the distinction the "not yet" cards now make explicit:
   some components are gated by a THRESHOLD you can cross by turning a slider
   (cache, CDN, shard), and others by a REQUIREMENT no amount of workload
   tuning will reach (a connection tier needs push; an analytical store needs
   someone to ask for aggregates). Both are reachable — but only one is
   reachable from the workload sliders, which is why the cards say which. */

/* Pairs, not just single knobs.

   The sweep below moves ONE workload knob at a time away from the defaults,
   and that was enough to reach every recommendation until the hardware
   constants were re-based on napkin-math's October 2026 measurements. A 50 µs
   durable write puts the write ceiling at 160,000/s instead of 26,667/s, and
   nothing one slider can do from the defaults produces the 80,000 writes/s
   that forces a log in front of the database — the biggest single-knob write
   rate in the space is 52,083/s.

   The log did not become unreachable in the product; it became unreachable in
   a sweep that only ever moved one thing. A write-heavy workload is two knobs
   (nobody reads, and everybody writes a lot), which is an ordinary shape and
   not a corner. So the sweep carries a short list of combinations, and this is
   the first one. */
