/* Two failure modes this file exists to prevent.

   1. A default that is not on its own ladder. The readout prints the stored
      value while the thumb sits on the nearest rung, so the slider says one
      number and the label says another — and the sandbox is quietly lying
      before the reader has touched anything.
   2. A ladder that is not monotonic, which makes the thumb travel backwards.

   Every chapter-5 sandbox on the site is covered, plus the capacity
   calculator's presets in calcModel.test.ts.

   Known gap: the chapter-3 hardware-envelope widgets declare their sliders
   inline in JSX, so their defaults are not swept here. Same invariant, no
   test — the first one that drifts will show a thumb on one rung and a label
   reading another, exactly as the fsync bug below did. */

/* The calculator's own inputs were never covered by the sweep above — it walks
   the six deep-dive sandboxes only. That gap shipped a real contradiction: the
   fsync constant defaulted to its MEASURED 300 µs while its ladder went
   ...200, 500..., so the thumb rendered on 200 while the label read 300 µs.
   Found by the latency page's copy of this same invariant.

   Both halves of that have since moved: the durable write is 50 µs on
   napkin-math's October 2026 numbers, and the 300 rung — which only ever
   existed to make the old measurement exactly representable — has come back
   off the ladder. The invariant is what keeps those two in step. */
