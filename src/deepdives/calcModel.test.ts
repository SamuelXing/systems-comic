       napkin-math's October 2026 pass put a durable write at 50 µs instead of
       300 µs, which lifts the write ceiling from 26,667/s to 160,000/s. A 3×

       the smoothed average. 31,250/s rather than 10,416.7/s, three times the

/* THE BUFFER-POOL CLIFF.
   A B-tree writes the row where it belongs, so it must first READ the leaf page
   that position sits on. Two things have to be true for that read to cost a
   disk seek: the insert point has to be somewhere unpredictable (a random id,
   a hash), AND a node's slice of the data has to have outgrown its RAM. Miss
   either and the page is already in the buffer pool and the read is free —
   which is why a B-tree feels fine for years and then does not.

   Both conditions are load-bearing, and the second test below is the one that
   keeps the model honest: without the key-shape condition every dataset larger
   than RAM would charge the penalty, and this page would answer "LSM" to
   everything — which it did, in a first attempt at this. */
