/**
 * The material the season close is built from — the last chapter of the
 * Epilogue, /papers/season-1, plus two things that live elsewhere.
 *
 * ARC and THREADS render inside that chapter (via SeasonBlocks.tsx): the acts
 * as the trade each one made, and the ideas that cross acts without ever
 * owning a chapter. CHAPTER_LINES goes somewhere else entirely — one line
 * under each row of the table of contents, so the map says what a chapter
 * claims and not only what it is called. The forward-look that used to sit at the
 * foot of the contents is gone: Season 2 has its own header there now, which
 * says the same thing in the place a reader is already looking.
 *
 * All of it is plain data keyed by chapter slug, so `season.test.ts` can pin
 * both directions: every live page has a line here, and every line here names
 * a page that exists. The prose is hand-written on purpose — a summary
 * generated from the deks would only repeat the deks.
