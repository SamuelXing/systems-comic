/* ============================================================
   The papers book — cover + season table of contents.
   The whole season is visible from day one, unwritten chapters
   included: the book's spine is the story arc, and the reader
   should see its shape before choosing where to step in.

   Two things sit under the map. Each row carries its chapter's
   one-line argument, so the contents say what a chapter claims
   and not only what it is called. And the foot looks forward to
   the next season — the looking-back is a page of its own, the
   last row of the Epilogue, because a retrospective printed here
   would be scenery rather than something anybody chose to read.
   ============================================================ */

/* One season at a time, and one nav item — the same split the two calculators

   finishes, and the two seasons ask different questions; putting them
