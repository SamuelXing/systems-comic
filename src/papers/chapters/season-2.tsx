/* The second close, and it works the way the first one does: nothing here is
   a new fact. Everything factual is somewhere else in the book; what is new is
   the arrangement, which is the only thing a chapter cannot supply about
   itself.

   Two things make this page different from Season 1's, and both come from the
   material rather than from wanting variety.

   Season 1's close can land a conclusion, because Season 1 converges — six
   acts making the same move, and an epilogue that ties it off. Season 2's body
   converges too, on the ladder, and that part is written the same way. Its
   ENDING does not. Chapters 29 and 30 reach opposite conclusions from the same
   observation, both shipped, both in production. So the last blocks of this
   page acknowledge the split and hand the reader a way to tell which one
   describes them — they do not pick, and they do not re-argue it either. The
   chapters already did the arguing; running it again in smaller type would be
   the epilogue with the interesting parts removed.

   Which is why the two-endings figure here is the same figure Chapter 30 ends
   on, reused deliberately rather than redrawn. A new drawing would imply a new
   claim. There isn't one. */

    'The trade this season argues about is not consistency against availability. It is **freshness against everything freshness costs** — and what made that a different argument from Season 1’s is that the data stopped sitting still and waiting to be visited. Read the chapters straight through and they look like thirteen unrelated systems. Read the acts and there is a ladder: each one takes a slice off the wait between an event and somebody seeing it, by a mechanism that has nothing to do with the others, and every single one sends the same bill. This page is that ladder, the ideas that cross it, and an ending the season declines to settle — because the field has not settled it either.',

        'It is worth being clear that this is not a gap in the book. Both papers shipped, both approaches are in production at scale, and companies run them together — a topic feeding a table that something else queries. *There is no experiment that settles it*, because the thing being optimised is not throughput. It is where you want your seams, which is a question about how many teams you have and how independently they deploy — which is exactly what the 2015 paper was saying when it listed organisational scalability beside throughput as a design requirement.',
        'So the useful question is not which one is right. It is **which one describes what you already have.** If you keep four copies of one dataset because the layer underneath could not update them atomically, that is waste, and Chapter 29 is about you. If you are running a search index and a columnar store because a full-text query and a scan of one column are genuinely different jobs, that is not waste, and no amount of merging will make it so — and then the thing worth fixing is the tangle of bespoke pipelines between them, which is Chapter 30. Most architectures have some of each, and the two chapters are better read as a diagnostic than as a choice.',

The ladder is an arrangement imposed afterwards by this book; it is a useful one and it is not a lineage. *Where Season 1 could say "and so, next, somebody did this", this season mostly cannot.*',

Materialize, ksqlDB and Flink SQL are named in passing rather than read, because Act III already reads the theory underneath all three.',
        '**And the sourcing is one-sided in the same way Season 1’s was.** Nearly every paper here comes from the company that shipped the system, describing the version that worked, with numbers no outsider can reproduce. This season adds a second-order version of the same problem: several of these papers are five to fifteen years old, and the clouds underneath them have changed twice — S3 gained strong consistency months after one of these papers described its absence as a design constraint, and gained the conditional write that retired a whole coordination service four years after that. **Treat every measurement here as a claim by an interested party about a machine that no longer exists.** Which is not a reason to disbelieve them, and is a reason to check the date before you quote a number.',

Make the change itself the thing being computed, so an answer is edited instead of rebuilt. Make convergence a property of the data, so that the copy in the tunnel is not a stale one — it is simply a copy. Four unrelated ideas, and every one of them is paid for in state that has to stay hot: memory that cannot spill, windows held open for arrivals that may never come, every difference kept and indexed, a change history nobody may truncate. That is the season, and it is the thing to carry out of it — when somebody offers you fresher data, the question is not whether the mechanism works, it is what has to stay resident for it to. And the ending is two people looking at the same heap of parts and disagreeing about whether the right move is to put the lid back on, which is not a hole in the argument. It is where the argument currently is.',
