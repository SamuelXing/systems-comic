/**
 * Route metadata — the single source for per-page <title>, description and
 * link-preview tags.
 *
 * This lives in plain .mjs, not TypeScript, because two very different things
 * need it: the running app (via Vite) and a post-build Node script that patches
 * the emitted HTML. A .ts module holding JSX-importing comics could not be read
 * by the second without a compile step.
 *
 * Comic titles are therefore duplicated from the comic files. `routes.test.ts`
 * asserts every entry still matches the comic it describes, so the duplication
 * cannot silently drift — which is the only reason it is acceptable.
 *
 * Descriptions are WRITTEN FOR A LINK PREVIEW, not copied from the page. A
 * preview has one or two lines to say why the link is worth a click; the page's
 * own opening sentence is usually the wrong shape for that.
